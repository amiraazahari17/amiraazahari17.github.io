		<h1> 'The Voice' top 10 results: Ain't no way</h1>
		<img src="homepage2.jpg" alt="voice" align="center" style="width:400px;height:300px">
		<p align="left">Two contestants went home on The Voice&apos;s top 10 results show Tuesday &boxh;  meaning for the first time this season,
		three contestants had to sing for the Instant Save. Two of those singers were, as I&apos;d predicted, Team J.Hud&apos;s Davon Fleming and 
		Shi&apos;Ann Jones &hellip; along with Team Miley&apos;s Ashland Craft, who&apos;d delivered a solid comeback performance on Monday but just
		wasn&apos;t able to make up for the momentum she&apos;d lost in previous weeks.So, if you were reading the above paragraph closely, 
		you may have noticed one very surprising omission from that bottom-three list: country crooner Adam Cunningham&comma; who&apos;d
		been up for elimination twice (including last week, when he controversially prevailed over Janice Freeman in the Instant Save sing-off).
		Somehow, the guy bucked the odds and emerged unscathed this week. And no one seemed more surprised than Cunningham himself; 
		in fact, he had that same dumbfounded,unblinking, dropped-jawed expression that he wore last week when he found out Janice was going home. 
		At least this week his coach, Adam Levine &mdash; who&apos;d sat unsmiling in his red chair when last Tuesday&apos;s shocker verdict was read 
		&mdash; seemed happy for his team member this week, as the two Adams locked in a celebratory bear hug.Actually, if you&apos;d paid close attention to iTunes this week, Tuesday&apos;s results 
		weren&apos;t a surprise. For the first time during Season 13&apos;s live shows, the iTunes chart accurately reflected America&apos;s overall voting pattern. 
		Shi&apos;Ann was dead last at No. 76, with Ashland at No. 48 and Davon at No. 31; Cunningham, conversely, peaked at a respectable No. 17, right 
		in between Noah Mac and Red Marlow.So, singing first for the Save was Ashland, looking like her fighting spirit was already totally crushed.
		The fire she brought to Monday&apos;s Joan Jett cover was snuffed out, and her Save Me song choice, the Keith Urban ballad &apos;Tonight I Wanna Cry,&quot;
		was all too prophetic. This was a decent effort, but the languid tune and Ashland&apos;s staid delivery didn&apos;t make much of an impact.</p>
